# Cypress Web Automation

This sample demonstrates end-to-end tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). A basic test visits the Cypress site and checks for a visible "Dashboard" link.

## Running the tests
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Execute the tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
