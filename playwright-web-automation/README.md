# Playwright Web Automation

This project showcases modern web automation using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). It includes a simple test written in TypeScript that navigates to the Playwright website, verifies the title, and checks for the installation section.

## Running the tests

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Execute the test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

Playwright provides cross-browser testing capabilities with advanced features such as auto-wait, built-in retries, and headless execution.
